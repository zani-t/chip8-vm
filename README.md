# CHIP-8 Emulator
This is a C++ based implementation of a CHIP-8 virtual machine. The repository includes an opcode test and two games (credit https://github.com/dmatlack/chip8/tree/master/roms/games).

Thanks to Austin Morlan and his page https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/ for helping me. Files include my own notes and questions from my experience of building the emulator and learning C++.

To run: ./chip8-vm 10 3 [ROM filepath]
